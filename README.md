        # Movies-ETL
 
 
The purpose of this project was to combine movie data from different sources to create more complete data.  Data was looked over for gaps or no values and it was cleaned up.  Certain columns were dropped if they were lacking enough pertinent information.  Then different dataframes were merged to create a more thorough table of different movies from kaggle and wiki.  The ratings data was in its own table due to it's size.  
 
In this project we also practiced making a function to create the dataframes as well as making tables in SQL.  Having tables in SQL, allows for easy access to counts and visualization of the columns.  We used prostresql.  The last code combined all of the original code plus the transfer of data to SQL.  Please note pngs for counts.
